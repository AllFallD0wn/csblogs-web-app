# Computer Science Blogs
The Computer Science Blogs project works to develop an open source blog aggregation system for Computer Scientists. 

CS Students, academics and those working in industry can set up a profile and open up their blog posts to a much wider audience.

They can also subscribe to feeds from certain institutions (e.g. All feeds from University of Hull alumni and students) or by topic (e.g. All feeds about C++).

The site is hosted at [csblogs.com](http://csblogs.com)

This project is in its infancy, so please do get involved.

Contact [Daniel Brown](mailto:d.t.brown@outlook.com) (project lead) if you require any information that isn't avaliable in the [documentation](http://docs.csblogs.com).
